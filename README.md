## NUMBER GAME (Task 1)
1. Generate a random number within a specified range, such as 1 to 100.
2. Prompt the user to enter their guess for the generated number.
3. Compare the user's guess with the generated number and provide feedback on whether the guess is correct, too high, or too low.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the user guesses the correct number.
5. Limit the number of attempts the user has to guess the number.
6. Add the option for multiple rounds, allowing the user to play again.
7. Display the user's score, which can be based on the number of attempts taken or rounds won


## STUDENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (Task 2)
1. Create a Student class to represent individual students. Include attributes such as name, roll
number, grade, and any other relevant details.
2. Implement a StudentManagementSystem class to manage the collection of students. Include
methods to add a student, remove a student, search for a student, and display all students.
3. Design the user interface for the Student Management System. This can be a console-based
interface or a graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries like Swing or JavaFX.
Implement methods to read and write student data to a storage medium, such as a file or a
database.
4. Allow users to interact with the Student Management System by providing options such as
adding a new student, editing an existing student's information, searching for a student, displaying all
students, and exiting the application.
5. Implement input validation to ensure that required fields are not left empty and that the student
data is in the correct format

## ATM INTERFACE (Task 3)
1. Create a class to represent the ATM machine.
2. Design the user interface for the ATM, including options such as withdrawing, depositing, and checking the balance.
3. Implement methods for each option, such as withdraw(amount), deposit(amount), and checkBalance().
4. Create a class to represent the user's bank account, which stores the account balance.
5. Connect the ATM class with the user's bank account class to access and modify the account balance.
6. Validate user input to ensure it is within acceptable limits (e.g., sufficient balance for withdrawals).
7. Display appropriate messages to the user based on their chosen options and the success or failure of their transactions.
